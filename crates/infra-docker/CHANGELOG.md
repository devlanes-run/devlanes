# devlanes-infra-docker

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [8015a60](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/8015a60fe48fae958e0fd0c22e0aa260c7c3acbc) Added idle lanes: after `lanes.freeze_after` (default 15m) without activity, devlanes freezes a lane's processes and its own containers, and the next request, connection or command resumes them.
  
  On macOS and Windows, `lanes.throttle_after` (default 5m) first runs an idle lane at background priority. Set `services.<name>.keep_awake: true` on workers that must keep running. `0s` turns either setting off. See `docs/guides/lifecycle.md`.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-26

- [b3a2ee0](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b3a2ee03f66aa8c7515008f37031468fbc92c2ae) Added `devlanes infra logs <container> [-f]` and Docker logs in the TUI pane when an infra container is selected, read from Docker and followed across container restarts.
