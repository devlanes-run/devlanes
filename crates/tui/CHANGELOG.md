# devlanes-tui

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-29

### Patch changes

- [31c5a3f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/31c5a3f75f97742e5b5f96d22567608c9929e1b3) Added `devlanes remote use` and the TUI's `m` key to choose which box serves a lane that several boxes run.
  
  A switch moves the lane's hostnames and ports to the other box at once and closes open connections to the old box. The same lane on two boxes is now mirrored from one of them, even when their hostnames differ. To work with both at once, run the lane under another lane number or project on one box. In the TUI, box lanes now join the lanes row of the local project with the same name, and lanes this machine does not mirror are grey. See [several boxes with the same project](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/blob/main/docs/guides/remote-multiple-boxes.md).

## 0.8.1 — 2026-10-28

### Patch changes

- [effb343](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/effb343649781d8c516285391605f27d192c66c0) Fixed `pty: true` units on Windows whose output leaves a color active stopping to follow the TUI pane's size, which left a gap of empty rows above the cursor and blank lines in the log, and a scrolled-back pane jumping up when the unit's screen got shorter.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-28

### Patch changes

- [0befd1d](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/0befd1d1c48705308b4dbd6c9759f8ee6d71d05c) Added `devlanes reload`, which applies project file and `.env` edits to a running lane: it stops removed services, restarts changed ones and starts added ones.
  
  `devlanes status` and the TUI show what each edit changed, `r` on a changed lane in the TUI reloads it, and `devlanes restart` without services restarts the whole lane instead of asking which to restart.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-10-28

Version bump only, to follow other packages.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-28

### Minor changes

- [0e02c1b](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/0e02c1b8e218bb470869e1e98c0631a5586ebf85) Changed how devlanes keeps a unit's output: `devlanes logs` holds each line once, as the unit's terminal showed it, also after a Windows console repaints its window on a resize, and the TUI's unit pane scrolls from the screen into older output and on into the log as one view, without flickering or switching to a separate stored-logs view.
  
  Typing into a unit or zooming its pane keeps its output on screen instead of reopening the stream. Lines a program rewrites in place (progress lines) are logged again with their new text, and output a program draws on the alternate screen (editors, pagers) is not logged.

### Patch changes

- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added `remote.start_daemon` to the user config of a box: set to `false`, `devlanes remote connect` no longer starts the box's daemon, and the client reports the stopped daemon and retries until it runs.
- [01fb93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/01fb93f56d3265cfe7756d4742dba08c93cc1fd0) Changed `s` in the TUI to mark the service queued at once, say what it waits for (`waiting for migrate-db`, `3rd in line`), ignore a second `s` on a queued service, and name start steps in the header as `containers` or the running task instead of raw phase names.
- [2af244b](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/2af244b6c8eec77b6612f01f916b06d8d21e0638) Fixed the TUI daemon page (`D`) scrolling its log seconds behind the mouse wheel.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added `infra.external.<name>` for a server devlanes does not run: every lane lists it as a unit of kind `external`, the proxy routes its `hosts` to its loopback `address`, and machines connected with `devlanes remote connect` mirror it while a lane of the project runs.
  
  A server only you run goes in `devlanes.local.yaml`; see `docs/guides/infra.md#external-ports`:
  
  ```yaml
  infra:
    external:
      pgadmin:
        address: 127.0.0.1:5050
        hosts: "pgadmin.${{ lane.domain }}"
  ```
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added a boxes view to the TUI (`B`) that connects, resumes and disconnects boxes and asks ssh's prompts and the pairing code there.
  
  Connected boxes' projects get tabs after the local ones (`acme @hetzner`), read-only, and a box unit's pane shows its ports, mirror state and the URLs that open it here. The view also lists this machine's clients: `x` revokes one after asking and `p` shows a pairing code for another machine. `devlanes remote ls --json` entries also carry the box's `registry`, each port's `state` and each route's `url`.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed `devlanes remote connect` so a box serves only machines it paired with, and added `devlanes daemon pair`, `devlanes daemon clients`, `devlanes daemon revoke`, `remote.require_pairing` and `remote.allow_connections`.
  
  A machine's first connection to a box needs a one-time code: run `devlanes daemon pair` on the box, then `devlanes remote connect <box> --code <code>` here, or enter the code when `devlanes remote connect <box>` asks. Later connections, including those after a daemon restart, need none. To let every machine that gets in over SSH connect without a code, as before, set `remote.require_pairing: false` in the box's user config. To turn every machine away, set `remote.allow_connections: false`. See "Pairing" in `docs/remote.md`.
- [45730f6](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/45730f6934a93a72ef532c225ec8eff85422004b) Changed the TUI monitor to sort units by name by default and switch the sort with the left and right arrows (`h` and `l` still fold lanes), and to draw each row's CPU history as dotted braille with two seconds per cell.
  
  The kind, peak and uptime headers now show their sort arrow instead of `…`, and uptimes of 10 hours or more no longer push the rest of the row out of line.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added `remote.boxes.<name>.command` to the user config, so `devlanes remote connect <name>` reaches a container, pod, WSL distribution or codespace by running a command such as `docker exec` instead of SSH.
  
  ```yaml
  remote:
    boxes:
      acme:
        command: [docker, exec, -i, acme, devlanes, tunnel, --stdio]
  ```
  
  See `docs/guides/remote-command.md`.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed the TUI's view buttons to `Monitor`, `Daemon` and `Boxes`, always shown, with the first letter as the key. When the top bar is too narrow, Monitor, then Daemon, then Boxes shrink to their letter.
- [76f6716](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/76f67163f90f6857092f8e42e44f1cbdc1acaf6d) Changed the TUI while the daemon restarts, stops or does not answer: every view shows what is happening above the live daemon log, the `devlanes` logo turns grey or red, and the view comes back once the daemon answers. Confirm dialogs no longer repeat their question as a title.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-27

Version bump only, to follow other packages.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [8015a60](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/8015a60fe48fae958e0fd0c22e0aa260c7c3acbc) Added idle lanes: after `lanes.freeze_after` (default 15m) without activity, devlanes freezes a lane's processes and its own containers, and the next request, connection or command resumes them.
  
  On macOS and Windows, `lanes.throttle_after` (default 5m) first runs an idle lane at background priority. Set `services.<name>.keep_awake: true` on workers that must keep running. `0s` turns either setting off. See `docs/guides/lifecycle.md`.

### Patch changes

- [ccb763b](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/ccb763b1808ffaa61af47dd781c70cca0644aa88) Fixed `devlanes` and `devlanes ui` showing "No projects yet" when opened in a repository with a devlanes.yaml that no other command had run in; the project now opens as a tab.
- [94453b9](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/94453b9363165ffe038e4e55ef40287ba4e35e1e) Fixed the monitor (`M`) erasing the graph history of units, lanes and containers once they stopped or were cleaned.
  
  They stay in the table as stopped until their samples leave the graph. A stopped lane no longer counts toward the monitor's current CPU and memory, and `status` no longer shows the last reading of a unit that failed.
- [a7472f6](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/a7472f6affae0e0d4e86ccfd7a26bb614a6c40b0) Fixed the first `devlanes` command on a busy machine, or one run while another started the daemon, failing with "daemon is unreachable" while the daemon was still starting.
  
  The command now waits as long as the daemon makes progress. When one startup step hangs for 30 seconds it fails with "the daemon has not finished starting", names the step and hints `devlanes daemon logs`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [edc8274](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/edc8274b1423f7370cbaaae258f617037857edf3) Changed a plain `devlanes start` (and `s` on a lane in the TUI) to bring back the services the lane ran before, after a reboot, a daemon crash or `daemon stop`, including ones started by name.
  
  `devlanes stop` without units now also forgets the lane's profiles, so the next plain start uses the `default` profile. A plain start names the other lanes that ran so `devlanes lane resume` can bring them back, and `devlanes with` no longer changes what a lane brings back. Set `start.restore: false` in `~/.devlanes/config.yaml` to always start the `default` profile.

### Patch changes

- [488f5be](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/488f5bee3ef717386e6ea4ece47870af144ce613) Changed http readiness timeouts to name the request that failed, such as `GET /-/health (Host: 127.0.0.1:20008) answered 404`, and to suggest `ready.http.host` alongside `path` and `status`.
- [9358913](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9358913dc7705cf14ec78ae44f957aad388bca01) Added a summary printed when the TUI closes: the devlanes banner, the lane shown last with its state, whether the daemon still runs, and the command that stops the lane while it runs.
- [8e3a939](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/8e3a9396b46ed150536bff85c2fd77575162cf26) Fixed the TUI pane losing its colors, cutting long lines and jumping back to the newest line when scrolling up past a service's or task's screen into its stored logs.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-10-26

### Patch changes

- [b3a2ee0](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b3a2ee03f66aa8c7515008f37031468fbc92c2ae) Added `devlanes run infra.setup.<name>` and `devlanes run infra.teardown.<name>` to run one setup or teardown entry. In the TUI, `s` and `r` on a setup step now run that entry instead of failing with "no lane or unit named setup.<name>" (a teardown step asks first), and steps are listed by their entry name, such as `databases` under `setup`.
- [9a6e93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9a6e93f88aa5ab73e833c4d16a7e5a654d448a88) Added scrolling and text selection to the checks box on the TUI's daemon page; there `Tab` moves between the checks and the log instead of switching projects.
- [057966d](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/057966d225932708635cc616c5e38afd80dce095) Changed the TUI monitor (`M`) to keep each project's shared infra on top and its lanes in lane order, and fixed its devlanes graphs showing less memory and CPU than used while shared containers run and drawing separate stripes for the time before it was open.
- [9a6e93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9a6e93f88aa5ab73e833c4d16a7e5a654d448a88) Changed the stop timeout warning in `devlanes doctor` and the TUI's daemon page to a shorter line, with its units listed on a separate line.
- [b3a2ee0](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b3a2ee03f66aa8c7515008f37031468fbc92c2ae) Added the TUI error list: `e`, or a click on the error in the header, shows the whole error the header cuts, steps back through earlier ones and copies them; a failed run of a task that has not run yet now shows on the task's row instead of the lane.
- [057966d](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/057966d225932708635cc616c5e38afd80dce095) Added the daemon's own CPU and memory to the TUI: a row pinned under the monitor's table (`M`) with its graphs, and a `usage` line on the daemon page (`D`).
- [057966d](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/057966d225932708635cc616c5e38afd80dce095) Changed the memory graph on the TUI monitor (`M`) to scale to the host's memory, draw the machine's used memory as a line and color only the seconds that were under memory pressure.
- [b3a2ee0](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b3a2ee03f66aa8c7515008f37031468fbc92c2ae) Added `devlanes infra logs <container> [-f]` and Docker logs in the TUI pane when an infra container is selected, read from Docker and followed across container restarts.

## 0.4.2 ... 0.4.3 — 2026-10-26

Version bump only, to follow other packages.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-26

### Patch changes

- [e7fccbd](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/e7fccbd548210a7d6a802badcaad39c8c8d47043) Added mouse selection to the daemon log in the TUI: dragging over it copies the text on release.
- [e7fccbd](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/e7fccbd548210a7d6a802badcaad39c8c8d47043) Fixed the TUI reporting `started` when a service it started could not run, for example a command missing from PATH; the service now shows `start failed` with the reason.
- [b8ce96e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b8ce96e40a27becff2afdb4f4c934e7bb358375d) Changed the TUI's first-run hint row into a welcome popup with the main features, the first keys and a link to the docs, so the footer is always a single row of keys.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-25

### Minor changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Removed the fnox integration: the `fnox` config key and `devlanes secrets unlock`.
  
  Configs with a `fnox:` key fail to load. Run the tool in the command instead, for example `fnox exec -- npm run dev`. `${{ env.X }}` now reads the client environment, then `.env`.

### Patch changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed the TUI daemon log's copy mode to work like a unit pane: move the cursor with `h j k l`, mark with `v`, copy the text as shown with `y` or the whole entries it touches with `Y`.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed the TUI to show the lanes beside the project name when there is only one project, which removes the separate lane row.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added colors to the level tags in the TUI daemon log.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Fixed the TUI monitor not showing the history recorded while the TUI was closed.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed TUI lane chips to show the lane's branch, with `@N` only when two lanes share a name. An extra lane on the same folder shows its own name.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed the mouse wheel in the TUI monitor to scroll the unit table without moving the selection.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Fixed the TUI daemon log scrolling into blank space when the log is short.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed the TUI to color project and lane names by state (green running, yellow starting or needing attention, red failed, dim idle) instead of showing state dots. The dots stay with `NO_COLOR` and the plain theme.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added a per-core CPU view to the TUI monitor. `m` puts memory in the large graph box and CPU in a small box with a square per core, and `c` switches back.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added the `infra.hosts` URLs of a container to `devlanes status` and the TUI container pane.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added `t` and `i` in the TUI lane tree to jump to the tasks and infra sections.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added WSL support: devlanes detects WSL and adapts to it.
  
  `devlanes url open` and `o` in the TUI open URLs in the Windows browser. A new `windows` target for `tls.trust` adds the CA to the Windows user store. Starting in a worktree under `/mnt/<drive>` warns, `doctor` gets a `wsl` group, and `daemon install` without systemd fails with the `wsl.conf` fix. See `docs/guides/wsl.md`.
