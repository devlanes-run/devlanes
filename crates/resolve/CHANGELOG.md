# devlanes-resolve

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-29

### Minor changes

- [31c5a3f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/31c5a3f75f97742e5b5f96d22567608c9929e1b3) Changed default lane domains to `<project><N>.localhost`, such as `acme2.localhost` instead of `acme-2.localhost`.
  
  Lane 0 keeps `acme.localhost`, and the `resolver` strategy gives `acme2.test`. A project that sets `lanes.vars.domain` keeps its own. Replace `acme-2.localhost` wherever you wrote it, such as `.env` files and OAuth redirect URIs. Lane 2 of `acme` and lane 0 of a project named `acme2` now share `acme2.localhost`, and devlanes warns about it with `host_conflict`.

### Patch changes

- [31c5a3f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/31c5a3f75f97742e5b5f96d22567608c9929e1b3) Added the `domain(name)` expression function, which gives a name its own site in each lane, such as `pages2.localhost` in lane 2, for user content that must not share the app's cookies.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-28

### Minor changes

- [0befd1d](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/0befd1d1c48705308b4dbd6c9759f8ee6d71d05c) Changed projects to be identified by their `project:` name, so one repository can hold several projects: a `devlanes.yaml` in a subdirectory, or another file such as `devlanes.prod.yaml` named once with the new `--file` flag and then with `-p`/`--project` (which also reads `DEVLANES_PROJECT`).
  
  Renaming `project:` now makes a new project; the old one's lanes stay until `devlanes lane gc --yes` cleans them. Another repository can no longer use a name already taken. In a project file below the worktree root, relative `cwd`, `run_script.file` and `sync` paths now start at that file's directory. `lanes.max` comes from the primary worktree's file, and a worktree whose file sets it, `lanes.primary` or shared infra differently gets a warning. Commands run inside a process devlanes started now default to that lane's project; pass `-p` to choose another. See [several projects in one repository](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/blob/main/docs/guides/services.md).

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-28

### Patch changes

- [01fb93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/01fb93f56d3265cfe7756d4742dba08c93cc1fd0) Fixed `devlanes start` of services on a lane that runs or is being brought up waiting for the lane's other starts: each start now shows its services as queued, with what they wait for, the moment it arrives, and joins the bring-up instead of running its tasks again.
- [01fb93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/01fb93f56d3265cfe7756d4742dba08c93cc1fd0) Added timings for every start step to `-v` output, with repeated steps added up into one row, and a `start finished` line per start in the daemon log that names its slowest phases and start slot waits.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [8015a60](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/8015a60fe48fae958e0fd0c22e0aa260c7c3acbc) Added idle lanes: after `lanes.freeze_after` (default 15m) without activity, devlanes freezes a lane's processes and its own containers, and the next request, connection or command resumes them.
  
  On macOS and Windows, `lanes.throttle_after` (default 5m) first runs an idle lane at background priority. Set `services.<name>.keep_awake: true` on workers that must keep running. `0s` turns either setting off. See `docs/guides/lifecycle.md`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-26

### Patch changes

- [488f5be](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/488f5bee3ef717386e6ea4ece47870af144ce613) Added `ready.http.host` to set the Host header an http readiness check sends, for apps that answer their health route only on their own hostname, such as `host: ${{ self.hosts[0] }}`.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-26

Version bump only, to follow other packages.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-25

### Minor changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Removed the fnox integration: the `fnox` config key and `devlanes secrets unlock`.
  
  Configs with a `fnox:` key fail to load. Run the tool in the command instead, for example `fnox exec -- npm run dev`. `${{ env.X }}` now reads the client environment, then `.env`.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Removed the `DEVLANES_PUBLIC_URL` variable that services received.
  
  Apps that read it get nothing now. Set it in the service's `env` instead:
  
  ```yaml
  env:
    DEVLANES_PUBLIC_URL: ${{ self.public_url }}
  ```
  
  `DEVLANES_PUBLIC_URL_<SERVICE>` in `with`, `exec` and `env show` is unchanged.
