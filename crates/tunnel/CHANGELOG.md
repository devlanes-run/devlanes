# devlanes-tunnel

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-28

### Minor changes

- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed the remote protocol to version 4, so `devlanes remote connect` works with boxes whose login shell or profile prints to stdout; the client and the box both need this release.
  
  To upgrade, install this release on the box yourself (devlanes no longer installs it there) and on this machine, then run `devlanes daemon restart` on both. Each daemon upgrades its state database on that first start, and earlier releases cannot open it afterwards. Then connect each box once with a pairing code: `devlanes daemon pair` on the box, `devlanes remote connect <box> --code <code>` here.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed `devlanes remote connect` so a box serves only machines it paired with, and added `devlanes daemon pair`, `devlanes daemon clients`, `devlanes daemon revoke`, `remote.require_pairing` and `remote.allow_connections`.
  
  A machine's first connection to a box needs a one-time code: run `devlanes daemon pair` on the box, then `devlanes remote connect <box> --code <code>` here, or enter the code when `devlanes remote connect <box>` asks. Later connections, including those after a daemon restart, need none. To let every machine that gets in over SSH connect without a code, as before, set `remote.require_pairing: false` in the box's user config. To turn every machine away, set `remote.allow_connections: false`. See "Pairing" in `docs/remote.md`.

### Patch changes

- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added `remote.start_daemon` to the user config of a box: set to `false`, `devlanes remote connect` no longer starts the box's daemon, and the client reports the stopped daemon and retries until it runs.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Fixed `devlanes remote connect` mirroring more than it should: boxes no longer send the names of `hidden` units or sync a hidden service's `sync` folders, a port a local program holds on one loopback address (on Windows, also the wildcard address) is no longer mirrored, and a box can no longer claim `localhost`, `*.localhost` or names under a local wildcard.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added Windows boxes for `devlanes remote connect`: a Windows machine with Windows' OpenSSH Server and devlanes installed can be a box, with cmd.exe, PowerShell or Git Bash as its SSH shell.
  
  See "Windows boxes" in `docs/guides/remote-setup.md`.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added the URLs connected clients open to `devlanes url print` on a box: in a terminal it prints `on <client>: <url>` for each machine connected with `devlanes remote connect`, or why the unit does not open there, and `--json` lists them under `clients`.
  
  `devlanes url ls` counts the hostnames each client reaches, and `devlanes status --json` lists each connected client with a stable `id`, its host `name` and what it mirrors (`clients[].mirror`).
