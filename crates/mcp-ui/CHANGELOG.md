## 0.2.0 — 2026-11-07

### Patch changes

- [5db5cde](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/5db5cdec69bc61915e31237b81abf0456a061bfc) Added `devlanes mcp`, an MCP server that lets AI agents run devlanes commands as tools.
  
  Register it with your agent, such as `claude mcp add devlanes -- devlanes mcp` for Claude Code. See [coding agents](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/blob/main/docs/guides/mcp.md) for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop and Goose.
  
  <!-- highlight
  title: Use devlanes from your agent over MCP
  body: Run `claude mcp add devlanes -- devlanes mcp` (or see `devlanes mcp --help` for other agents) and the agent starts dev servers with `exec`, reads logs and stops what it started, asking you before it deletes lane data.
