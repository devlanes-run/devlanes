# devlanes-cli

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-27

### Patch changes

- [2a26145](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/2a26145f9557581e398d512bc8d4f00fad683256) Added a `devlanes doctor` warning when another program listens on the proxy's HTTP or HTTPS port, which on Windows happens with a local reverse proxy on 443 or 80 that then stops getting requests to `localhost`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [8015a60](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/8015a60fe48fae958e0fd0c22e0aa260c7c3acbc) Added idle lanes: after `lanes.freeze_after` (default 15m) without activity, devlanes freezes a lane's processes and its own containers, and the next request, connection or command resumes them.
  
  On macOS and Windows, `lanes.throttle_after` (default 5m) first runs an idle lane at background priority. Set `services.<name>.keep_awake: true` on workers that must keep running. `0s` turns either setting off. See `docs/guides/lifecycle.md`.

### Patch changes

- [ccb763b](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/ccb763b1808ffaa61af47dd781c70cca0644aa88) Changed `devlanes status` and `devlanes lane ls` to say when nothing is running, and for a single idle lane to print the `devlanes start --lane` command that starts it.
- [a7472f6](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/a7472f6affae0e0d4e86ccfd7a26bb614a6c40b0) Fixed the first `devlanes` command on a busy machine, or one run while another started the daemon, failing with "daemon is unreachable" while the daemon was still starting.
  
  The command now waits as long as the daemon makes progress. When one startup step hangs for 30 seconds it fails with "the daemon has not finished starting", names the step and hints `devlanes daemon logs`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [edc8274](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/edc8274b1423f7370cbaaae258f617037857edf3) Changed a plain `devlanes start` (and `s` on a lane in the TUI) to bring back the services the lane ran before, after a reboot, a daemon crash or `daemon stop`, including ones started by name.
  
  `devlanes stop` without units now also forgets the lane's profiles, so the next plain start uses the `default` profile. A plain start names the other lanes that ran so `devlanes lane resume` can bring them back, and `devlanes with` no longer changes what a lane brings back. Set `start.restore: false` in `~/.devlanes/config.yaml` to always start the `default` profile.

### Patch changes

- [6b60828](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/6b608289d00c02d7f6181fad56def7e8546e3977) Added `devlanes config get`, `set` and `unset` to read and change the user config.yaml.
- [488f5be](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/488f5bee3ef717386e6ea4ece47870af144ce613) Changed http readiness timeouts to name the request that failed, such as `GET /-/health (Host: 127.0.0.1:20008) answered 404`, and to suggest `ready.http.host` alongside `path` and `status`.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-10-26

### Patch changes

- [9a6e93f](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9a6e93f88aa5ab73e833c4d16a7e5a654d448a88) Changed the stop timeout warning in `devlanes doctor` and the TUI's daemon page to a shorter line, with its units listed on a separate line.
- [b3a2ee0](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/b3a2ee03f66aa8c7515008f37031468fbc92c2ae) Added `devlanes infra logs <container> [-f]` and Docker logs in the TUI pane when an infra container is selected, read from Docker and followed across container restarts.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-26

### Patch changes

- [181698e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/181698ebbe25612c1149bb1c157857ff6acadf85) Changed `daemon status` and `doctor` on Windows to label the daemon's named pipe as `pipe` instead of `socket`.
- [181698e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/181698ebbe25612c1149bb1c157857ff6acadf85) Added `devlanes daemon start`, which starts the daemon in the background unless it already runs and prints its status.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-25

### Minor changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Removed the fnox integration: the `fnox` config key and `devlanes secrets unlock`.
  
  Configs with a `fnox:` key fail to load. Run the tool in the command instead, for example `fnox exec -- npm run dev`. `${{ env.X }}` now reads the client environment, then `.env`.

### Patch changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added `devlanes env export --shell pwsh` for Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. The default, `posix`, is unchanged.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed `devlanes with` to skip the peak table when it is empty, and on an interactive terminal; CI output, pipes and the step summary still get it.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Fixed `devlanes stop --logs-dir` printing output with `--quiet`.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added the `infra.hosts` URLs of a container to `devlanes status` and the TUI container pane.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added a prompt to `devlanes lane new` that asks whether to start the new lane when run without `--start` on a terminal.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added WSL support: devlanes detects WSL and adapts to it.
  
  `devlanes url open` and `o` in the TUI open URLs in the Windows browser. A new `windows` target for `tls.trust` adds the CA to the Windows user store. Starting in a worktree under `/mnt/<drive>` warns, `doctor` gets a `wsl` group, and `daemon install` without systemd fails with the `wsl.conf` fix. See `docs/guides/wsl.md`.
