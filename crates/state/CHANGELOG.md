# devlanes-state

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-28

### Minor changes

- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed `devlanes remote connect` to reconnect boxes after a daemon restart until `devlanes remote disconnect`, and to wait for another `devlanes remote connect` instead of failing when a reconnect needs a password or new credentials.
  
  While a box waits, `devlanes remote ls` and `devlanes status --json` show `needs_auth` with the command to run, and its hostnames show a sign-in page (DL205). Boxes connected before this release are not reconnected on their own; run `devlanes remote connect <box>` once.
- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Changed `devlanes remote connect` so a box serves only machines it paired with, and added `devlanes daemon pair`, `devlanes daemon clients`, `devlanes daemon revoke`, `remote.require_pairing` and `remote.allow_connections`.
  
  A machine's first connection to a box needs a one-time code: run `devlanes daemon pair` on the box, then `devlanes remote connect <box> --code <code>` here, or enter the code when `devlanes remote connect <box>` asks. Later connections, including those after a daemon restart, need none. To let every machine that gets in over SSH connect without a code, as before, set `remote.require_pairing: false` in the box's user config. To turn every machine away, set `remote.allow_connections: false`. See "Pairing" in `docs/remote.md`.

### Patch changes

- [9c1090e](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/9c1090e6d6e5bc7557453415dc9732bcab1dfe84) Added `infra.external.<name>` for a server devlanes does not run: every lane lists it as a unit of kind `external`, the proxy routes its `hosts` to its loopback `address`, and machines connected with `devlanes remote connect` mirror it while a lane of the project runs.
  
  A server only you run goes in `devlanes.local.yaml`; see `docs/guides/infra.md#external-ports`:
  
  ```yaml
  infra:
    external:
      pgadmin:
        address: 127.0.0.1:5050
        hosts: "pgadmin.${{ lane.domain }}"
  ```

Version bump only, to follow other packages.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-26

### Minor changes

- [edc8274](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/edc8274b1423f7370cbaaae258f617037857edf3) Changed a plain `devlanes start` (and `s` on a lane in the TUI) to bring back the services the lane ran before, after a reboot, a daemon crash or `daemon stop`, including ones started by name.
  
  `devlanes stop` without units now also forgets the lane's profiles, so the next plain start uses the `default` profile. A plain start names the other lanes that ran so `devlanes lane resume` can bring them back, and `devlanes with` no longer changes what a lane brings back. Set `start.restore: false` in `~/.devlanes/config.yaml` to always start the `default` profile.
